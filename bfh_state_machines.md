# State Machines & Signals

This page details the various state machines used in the firmware.

As explained in another page, QM modeling tool __was not__ used to create the various code representing the 
state machines of the system. Instead, they were all coded by hand, deriving from the proper QP base class.

    > I later used QM modeling tool to try it out, and re-modeled some of the state machines
    > of this project (LwIPMgr_AO and DisplayMgr_AO).
    > I found really useful that the tool both generates the code, and the state machine diagrams.
    > 
    > This removes the step of having to use other tools to create UML state machine diagrams,
    > thus following the "don't repeat yourself" (DRY) rule.
 
## RTCC_AO
 
The RTCC manages the periodic and alarm interrupts.
 
When one of the two happen, it simply publish an event to the QP framework that such thing occurred.

    > The periodic interrupt can be set to the desired response granularity of the system.
    > For instance, it is possible to set the periodic alarm to every minute,
    > leaving the system in low power mode in between interrupts.
    >
    > Currently the periodic interrupt is set to the second for better observability.

### Signal List


| Signal Name | Direction | Parameter | Comments |
|:------------|:----------|:----------|:---------|
| SIG_RTCC_INTERRUPT | In | None | Generated by RTCC. Two alarm sources: Time base tick. Calendar event alarm. | 
| SIG_RTCC_TIME_TICK_ALARM | Out | Time and Date | Signals newest time and date (and temperature?) |
| SIG_RTCC_CALENDAR_EVENT_ALARM | Out | Time and Date | Signals a calendar event occured, at given Time and Date. |
| SIG_RTCC_SAVE_TO_NV_MEM | In | IsDBChanged | Used to update the whole DB into the NV memory (RAM). |
| SIG_RTCC_SET_TIME | In | Time | Sets new time to set the RTCC to. Triggers new calendar event alarm. |
| SIG_RTCC_SET_DATE | In | Date | Sets new date to set the RTCC to. Triggers new calendar event alarm. |

## LwIPMgr_AO
 
This is the state machine responsible for managing the low-level Ethernet driver with respect to signals.
 
It is copied over 95% of the original application note from QP on how to use LwIP in conjunction with QP,
found [here](https://www.state-machine.com/doc/AN_QP_and_lwIP.pdf)

## BFHMgr_AO

The state machine responsible for handling the various feeding and alarm events.

### Signal List

| Signal Name | Direction | Parameter | Comments |
|:------------|:----------|:----------|:---------|
| SIG_RTCC_CALENDAR_EVENT_ALARM | In | Time and Date references | Triggers a timed feeding, from scheduled calendar. |
| SIG_FEED_MGR_MANUAL_FEED_CMD | In | State (on, off) | Triggers a manual feeding, or exit of it. From manual toggle sensor pad. |
| SIG_FEED_MGR_TIMED_FEED_CMD | In | Feeding time | Triggers a timed feeding. From Pet Touch Pad or other. |
| SIG_FEED_MGR_TIMEOUT | In | None | Feeding timeout, Maximum security feeding timeout or debouncing timeout. |
