@section ab_about What is it?
<a class="extern" target="_blank" href="https://www.state-machine.com/products/qp/"><strong>QP/C++&trade; (Quantum Platform in C++)</strong></a> is a lightweight <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="https://www.state-machine.com/rtef/"><strong>Real-Time Embedded Framework (RTEF)</strong></a> for building modern, responsive and modular real-time embedded applications as systems of asynchronous event-driven <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="https://www.state-machine.com/active-object/"><strong>active objects</strong></a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">actors</a>). QP/C++&trade; is a member of a larger family of real-time embedded frameworks (RTEFs) consisting of QP/C++ and <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/products/qp/" target="_blank" class="extern">QP/C</a> frameworks, which are all strictly quality controlled, thoroughly documented, and available under @ref licensing "dual licensing model".

The behavior of active objects is specified in QP/C++ by means of <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/fsm/#HSM" target="_blank" class="extern"><strong>hierarchical state machines</strong></a> (UML statecharts). The framework supports @ref sm "manual coding of UML state machines in C++" as well as automatic code generation by means of the free <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/products/qm/"><strong>QM&trade; model-based design tool</strong></a>.

@attention
To use QP/C++&trade; effectively, you need to understand the <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/category/concepts/" target="_blank" class="extern"><strong>key concepts</strong></a> that underline the architecture of the framework and your applications based on the framework.


@section ab_goals What does it do?
The main goals of the QP/C++&trade; framework are:
- to provide a reusable **architecture** based on <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="https://www.state-machine.com/active-object/">active objects (actors)</a>, which is _safer_ and easier to understand than "free-threading" with a traditional RTOS.
- to provide a simple-to-use coding techniques for @ref sm "hierarchical state machines", with which to implement the behavior of active objects.
- to provide efficient and thread-safe event-driven mechanisms for active objects to communicate, such as direct event passing and publish-subscribe.
- to provide event-driven timing services (time events).
- to provide a selection of built-in real-time kernels to run the QP applications, such as the cooperative @ref qv "QV kernel", the preemptive non-blocking @ref qk "QK kernel", and the preemptive blocking @ref qxk "QXK kernel".
- to provide testing support for applications based on software tracing (@ref qs "Q-Spy").
- to provide **unit testing** support for applications based on software tracing (<a href="https://www.state-machine.com/qtools/qutest.html"><strong>QUTest&trade;</strong></a>).
- to provide portability layer and ready-to-use ports to @ref ports_rtos "3rd-party RTOSes" and general purpose operating systems such as @ref posix "Linux" and @ref win32 "Windows".
- to provide a target for modeling and automatic code generation from the <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/products/qm" target="_blank" class="extern"><strong>QM&trade; modeling tool</strong></a>.


@section ab_special What's special about it?
The QP/C++&trade; Real-Time Embedded Framework (RTEF) is a unique offering on the embedded software market. It provides a modern, reusable **architecture** of embedded applications, which combines object-orientation and @ref sm "hierarchical state machines" with the particular model of concurrency, known as <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="https://www.state-machine.com/active-object/"><strong>active objects</strong></a> (actors). This architecture is generally **safer**, more responsive and easier to understand than "free threading" with a traditional Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). It also provides sufficiently high level of abstraction and the right abstractions to effectively apply modeling and code generation to deeply embedded systems.


@subsection oop Object Orientation
QP/C++&trade; is fundamentally an **object-oriented** framework, which means that the framework itself and your applications derived from the framework are fundamentally composed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)" target="_blank" class="extern">classes</a> and only classes can have @ref sm "state machines" associated with them.


@subsection lightweight Lightweight
The most unique characteristic of the QP/C++&trade; framework is its very small footprint, especially in RAM. In this respect, QP/C++&trade; requires less resources than even the smallest conventional Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) kernel. At the same time, QP/C++ gives you a much higher level of abstraction than a conventional RTOS. With QP, you work at the level of active objects, state machines and events, as opposed to "naked" threads of an RTOS.


@subsection hsms Hierarchical State Machines
The behavior of active objects is specified in QP/C++ by means of <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="https://www.state-machine.com/fsm/#HSM">hierarchical state machines (UML statecharts)</a>. The framework supports @ref sm "manual coding of UML state machines in C++" (or C in case of QP/C) as well as fully **automatic code generation** by means of the free graphical <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="https://www.state-machine.com/products/qm/">QM&trade; model-based design (MBD) tool</a>.

@remarks
State machines can be an incredibly powerful technique, but they require an event-driven **infrastructure** (framework) that provides, at a minimum: a run-to-completion (RTC) execution context for each state machine, queuing of events, and event-based timing services. This is really the pivotal point. Without an event-driven framework (like QP/C++), state machines are like <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="https://www.state-machine.com/rtef/">cars without an infrastructure of roads</a>.


@subsection kernels Built-in Kernels
The QP&trade;/C++ framework can run on @ref exa_native "bare-metal single-chip microcontrollers", completely replacing a traditional RTOS. The framework contains a selection of built-in real-time kernels, such as the cooperative @ref qv "QV kernel", the preemptive non-blocking @ref qk "QK kernel", and the preemptive, dual-mode, blocking @ref qxk "QXK kernel". The QXK kernel <span class="highlight">provides all the features you might expect from a traditional <strong>RTOS kernel</strong></span> and has been specifically designed for mixing event-driven active objects with traditional blocking code, such as commercial middleware (TCP/IP stacks, UDP stacks, embedded file systems, etc.) or legacy software. @ref ports_native "Native QP ports" and ready-to-use @ref exa_native "examples" are provided for major @ref exa_ref_mcu "CPU families".


@subsection inter Interoperability
QP/C++ can also work with many traditional @ref exa_rtos "RTOSes" and @ref exa_rtos "desktop OSes" (such as Windows and Linux).


@subsection popular Popularity &amp; Maturity
With over 15 years of continuous development and <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/qpc/files/stats/timeline?dates=2016-01-01+to+2016-12-31">60,000 downloads a year</a>, the QP&trade; RTEF family is the most mature and popular such solution on the embedded software market. The QP&trade; frameworks are used in <a href="https://www.state-machine.com/customers" target="_blank" class="extern">millions of products worldwide</a> in medical devices, consumer electronics, wired and wireless telecommunications, industrial automation, transportation, aerospace, robotics, and many more.


@subsection psicc2 Book
The book, <a class="extern" target="_blank" href="https://www.state-machine.com/psicc2" ><strong>Practical UML Statecharts in C/C++, 2nd Edition</strong></a> provides a detailed design study of the QP frameworks and explains all the related concepts.
