                            Express Logic's ThreadX for Win32 

                              Using the Microsoft Tools

                                *** DEMO VERSION ***

0. About This Version

This version of ThreadX is for demonstration purposes only and may not
be used for any product development, either directly or indirectly. In 
addition, this demonstration may not be used for any competitive purpose.


1. Installation

ThreadX for the Win32 is delivered on a single CD-ROM compatible disk. 
The entire distribution can be found in the sub-directory:

\threadx

To install ThreadX to your hard-disk, either run the supplied installer 
program Setup.exe or copy the distribution from the CD manually. 

To copy the ThreadX distribution manually, make a threadx directory on your 
hard-disk (we recommend c:\threadx\win32\microsoft) and copy all the contents 
of the threadx sub-directory on the distribution disk. The following 
is an example MS-DOS copy command from the distribution directory
(assuming source is d: and c: is your hard-drive):


d:\threadx> xcopy /S *.* c:\threadx\win32\microsoft


2. Open the ThreadX Project Workspace

In order to build the ThreadX library and the ThreadX demonstration first
load the ThreadX project workspace ThreadX_Workspace.dsw (Visual C/C++) or 
ThreadX_Workspace.sln (Visual Studio), which is located inside your 
ThreadX directory:

c:\threadx\win32\microsoft\ThreadX_Workspace.dsw


3. Building the ThreadX run-time Library

The demonstration version contains a pre-built ThreadX library. The library is 
intended for demonstration purposes only and thus has the following limitations:

                11 Threads
                9  Timers
                2  Event Flag Groups
                2  Mutexes
                3  Queues
                2  Semaphores
                1  Block Pool
                1  Byte Pool

Note that performance monitoring and event tracking are also enabled by 
default in this version.

Please contact Express Logic for more information or if you have any 
questions regarding the demonstration or additional Express Logic products
such as NetX, FileX and USBX.


4.  Building the Demonstration System

You are now ready to run the ThreadX Win32 demonstration. Simply make the 
"demo_thread" project active and then select the build button. When the build
is finished, select the run button from Visual C/C++ (or Visual Studio) and 
observe various demonstration statistics being printed to the console window. 
You may also set breakpoints, single step, perform data watches, etc.


5.  System Initialization

The system entry point is at main(), which is defined in the application. 
Once the application calls tx_kernel_enter, ThreadX starts running and 
performs various initialization duties prior to starting the scheduler. The 
Win32-specific initialization is done in the function _tx_initialize_low_level,
which is located in the file tx_initialize_low_level.c. This function is 
responsible for setting up various system data structures and simulated 
interrupts - including the periodic timer interrupt source for ThreadX.

In addition, _tx_initialize_low_level determines the first available 
address for use by the application. In Win32, this is basically done
by using malloc to get a big block of memory from Windows.


6.  Win32 Implementation

ThreadX for Win32 is implemented using Win32 threads. Each application
thread in ThreadX actually runs as a Win32 thread. The determination of
which application thread to run is made by the ThreadX scheduler, which 
itself is a Win32 thread. The ThreadX scheduler is the highest priority 
thread in the system.

Interrupts in ThreadX/Win32 are also simulated by threads. A good example
is the ThreadX system timer interrupt, which can be found in 
tx_initialize_low_level.c.

6.1  ThreadX Limitations

ThreadX for Win32 behaves in the same manner as ThreadX in an embedded 
environment EXCEPT in the case of thread termination. Unfortunately, the 
Win32 API does not have a good mechanism to terminate threads and instead
must rely on the thread itself terminating. Hence, threads in the ThreadX
Win32 implementation must have some ThreadX call periodically in their 
processing if they can be terminated by another ThreadX thread.


7.  Improving Performance

The distribution version of ThreadX is built without any compiler 
optimizations. This makes it easy to debug because you can trace or set 
breakpoints inside of ThreadX itself. Of course, this costs some 
performance. To make it run faster, you can change the tx project file to 
enable all compiler optimizations. In addition, you can eliminate the 
ThreadX basic API error checking by compiling your application code with the 
symbol TX_DISABLE_ERROR_CHECKING defined.


8.  Interrupt Handling

ThreadX provides simulated interrupt handling with Win32 threads. Simulated
interrupt threads may be created by the application or may be added to the
simulated timer interrupt defined in tx_initialize_low_level.c. The following 
format for creating simulated interrupts should be used:

8.1  Data structures

Here is an example of how to define the Win32 data structures and prototypes
necessary to create a simulated interrupt thread:

HANDLE       _sample_win32_interrupt_handle;
DWORD        _sample_win32_interrupt_id;
DWORD WINAPI _sample_win32_interrupt(LPVOID);


8.2  Creating a Simulated Interrupt Thread

Here is an example of how to create a simulated interrupt thread in Win32.
This may be done inside of tx_initialize_low_level.c or from your application code

        _sample_win32_interrupt_handle =
            CreateThread(NULL, 0, _sample_win32_interrupt, (LPVOID) &_sample_win32_interrupt_handle,
                    CREATE_SUSPENDED, &_sample_win32_interrupt_id);

        SetThreadPriority(_sample_win32_interrupt_handle, THREAD_PRIORITY_BELOW_NORMAL);


8.3  Activating the Simulated Interrupt Thread

Simulated interrupt threads should not be activated until initialization is complete, i.e. until
ThreadX is ready to schedule threads. The following activation code may be added to the routine
in tx_initialize_low_level.c called _tx_initialize_start_interrupts or into the application code directly:

        ResumeThread(_sample_win32_interrupt_handle);


8.4  Simulated Interrupt Thread Template

The following is a template for the simulated interrupt thread. This interrupt will occur on
a periodic basis. 

DWORD WINAPI _sample_win32_interrupt(LPVOID *ptr)
{


    while(1)
    {

        /* Sleep for the desired time.  */
        Sleep(18);

        /* Call ThreadX context save for interrupt preparation.  */
        _tx_thread_context_save();

        /* Call application ISR here!  */

        /* Call ThreadX context restore for interrupt completion.  */
        _tx_thread_context_restore();
    } 
}
