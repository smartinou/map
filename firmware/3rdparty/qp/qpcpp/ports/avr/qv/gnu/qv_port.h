// NOTE1:
// As described in the "AVR Datasheet" in Section "Reset and Interrupt
// Handling", when using the SEI instruction to enable interrupts, the
// instruction following SEI will be executed before any pending interrupts.
// As the Datasheet shows in the assembly example, the pair of instructions
//     SEI       ; enable interrupts
//     SLEEP     ; go to the sleep mode
// executes ATOMICALLY, and so no interrupt can be serviced between these
// instructins. You should NEVER separate these two lines.
