## Pet Feeder Pet Project (PFPP)

(Also formaly known as Beast Fead'Her or BFH for short.)

PFPP is the 1st (and only) project currently done in MAP.
PFPP is a smart, connected pet feeder for my pet cat.

The reasons why I wanted to do this project (beside the obvious utility to feed my cat while I'm out!) are:

*  Learn about QP event-driven state-machine framework.
*  Learn about ARM-Cortex M3 MCU.
*  Learn about IoT and mobile applications.
