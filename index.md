# Welcome to Martin's Awesome Project (MAP) page. Enter my lair!

This is GitHub page page to describe the various projects done in that repo.

## Beast Fead'Her (BFH)

BFH is the 1st (and only) project currently done in MAP.
BFH is a smart, connected pet feeder for my pet cat.

The reasons why I wanted to do this project (beside the obvious utility to feed my cat while I'm out!) are:

*  Learn about QP event-driven state-machine framework.
*  Learn about ARM-Cortex M3 MCU.
*  Learn about IoT and mobile applications.

### Design Documents

*  [Architecture](./bfh_electronics)
*  [Firmware](./bfh_firmware)
*  [software](./bfh_software)
